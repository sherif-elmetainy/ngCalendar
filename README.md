# ngCalendar

## About
ngCalendar is an calendar using [Angular 2](https://angular.io). This library is inspired by the [Adam Shaws's Full Calendar Component](http://fullcalendar.io/), and it borrows some its CSS styles, though the implementation is totally different.

## Status
The library is not at a state of being usable yet. It's currently no more than a preview. I still didn't make an npm package, 

To start testing the library run the following commands.
```
git clone https://github.com/sherif-elmetainy/ngCalendar
cd ngCalendar/src/ngCalendar.Web
npm install
gulp less
npm tsc
npm start
```

## TODO
Provided I have time, this library still needs a lot more work and documentation.
